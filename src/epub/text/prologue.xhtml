								<span>New Playes, and Maydenheads, are neare a kin,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Much follow’d both, for both much mony g’yn,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If they stand sound, and well: And a good Play</span>
								<br/>
								<span>(Whose modest Sceanes blush on his marriage day,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And shake to loose his honour) is like hir</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That after holy Tye and first nights stir</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet still is Modestie, and still retaines</span>
								<br/>
								<span>More of the maid to sight, than Husbands paines;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We pray our Play may be so; For I am sure</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It has a noble Breeder, and a pure,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A learned, and a Poet never went</span>
								<br/>
								<span>More famous yet twixt Po and silver Trent:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Chaucer (of all admir’d) the Story gives,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There constant to Eternity it lives.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If we let fall the Noblenesse of this,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the first sound this child heare, be a hisse,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How will it shake the bones of that good man,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And make him cry from under ground, “O fan</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From me the witles chaffe of such a wrighter</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That blastes my Bayes, and my fam’d workes makes lighter</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then Robin Hood!” This is the feare we bring;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For to say Truth, it were an endlesse thing,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And too ambitious, to aspire to him,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Weake as we are, and almost breathlesse swim</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In this deepe water. Do but you hold out</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Your helping hands, and we shall take about,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And something doe to save us: You shall heare</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sceanes, though below his Art, may yet appeare</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Worth two houres travell. To his bones sweet sleepe:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Content to you. If this play doe not keepe</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A little dull time from us, we perceave</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our losses fall so thicke, we must needs leave. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Florish.</i></span>
