								<span>I would now ask ye how ye like the play;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But, as it is with school-boys, cannot say</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I’m cruel fearful. Pray, yet stay a while</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And let me look upon ye. No man smile?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then it goes hard, I see. He that has</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lov’d a young handsome wench, then, show his face⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Tis strange if none be here⁠—and, if he will</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Against his conscience, let him hiss, and kill</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our market. ’Tis in vain, I see, to stay ye:</span>

								<br/>
								<span>And yet mistake me not; I am not bold;</span>

								<br/>
								<span>For to that honest purpose it was meant ye⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We have our end; and ye shall have ere long,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I dare say, many a better, to prolong</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Your old loves to us. We and all our might</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rest at your service: gentlemen, good night. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Flourish.</i></span>
