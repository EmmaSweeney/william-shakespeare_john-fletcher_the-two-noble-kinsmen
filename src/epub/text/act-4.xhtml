									<span>No stirring in him, no alacrity,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of all this sprightly sharpenes not a smile;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet these that we count errours may become him:</span>

									<span>Narcissus was a sad Boy, but a heavenly:â€”</span>

									<span>And only beutifull, and these the eyes,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>These the bright lamps of beauty, that command</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And threaten Love, and what yong Mayd dare crosse 'em?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Has this browne manly face! O Love, this only</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From this howre is Complexion: Lye there, Arcite,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou art a changling to him, a meere Gipsey,</span>

							<td>That intemprat surfeit of her eye hath distemperd the other sences: they may returne and settle againe to execute their preordaind faculties, but they are now in a most extravagant vagary. This you must doe: Confine her to a place, where the light may rather seeme to steale in, then be permitted; take vpon you (yong Sir, her friend) the name of Palamon; say you come to eate with her, and to commune of Love; this will catch her attention, for this her minde beates upon; other objects that are inserted tweene her minde and eye become the prankes and friskins of her madnes; Sing to her such greene songs of Love, as she sayes Palamon hath sung in prison; Come to her, stucke in as sweet flowers as the season is mistres of, and thereto make an addition of som other compounded odours, which are grateful to the sence: all this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can sing, and Palamon is sweet, and ev'ry good thing: desire to eate with her, carve her, drinke to her, and still among, intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance into her favour: Learne what Maides have beene her companions and play-pheeres, and let them repaire to her with Palamon in their mouthes, and appeare with tokens, as if they suggested for him. It is a falsehood she is in, which is with falsehood to be combated. This may bring her to eate, to sleepe, and reduce what's now out of square in her, into their former law, and regiment; I have seene it approved, how many times I know not, but to make the number more, I have great hope in this. I will, betweene the passages of this project, come in with my applyance: Let us put it in execution, and hasten the successe, which, doubt not, will bring forth comfort. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Florish.
